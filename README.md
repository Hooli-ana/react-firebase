# React Firebase Homework

In this assignment you will practice connecting to a preset Firebase database and then display the response on the page in the list. All of the components that you will need are already built and you will not need to create another component to complete this homework.

You will want to create a .env file and use the code below in order to connect to the database.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=AIzaSyCvANmQzk3G-tGFgLi1bYCm5jLrJF5rrXA
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=ga-memes-dev.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=https://ga-memes-dev.firebaseio.com
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=ga-memes-dev.appspot.com
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1091194844530
```

### Challenge
Use the Meme and MemeList components to display the images that are associated with each of the motivations. There should be 8 for each day.
